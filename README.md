# Admin Work Samples

Welcome! This repository showcases examples of my administrative and executive support skills, including:

- **Task Tracking:** Realistic daily task tracker showing workflow management, email filing, and client follow-ups. (`Task_Tracker.csv`)  
- **SOP Documentation:** Standard Operating Procedure for email filing, highlighting organization, attention to detail, and process orientation. (`Email_Filing_SOP.md`)

These samples reflect my experience as a Secretary, Administrative Assistant, Client Experience Specialist, and Customer Service Representative.  
They demonstrate my ability to stay organized, manage tasks efficiently, and provide professional support in remote settings.
